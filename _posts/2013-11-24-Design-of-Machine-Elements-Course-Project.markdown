<font size="3"><b>Abstract</b></font>
<p align="justify">The objective of the project is to write a MATLAB code to design the various elements of the hand held drilling machine based on the input given by the user. The algorithm starts with the design of gears based on the inputs like tip force and power of the spindle and then move towards the design of shafts followed by bearings and then springs and keys. Then the bolted joints for the housing design is done. At each stage, the algorithm for design of each element is implemented with the user validating the design at every point.</p>
