<font size="3"><b>Targeted Area</b></font>
<p align="justify">One of the predominant ankle gait abnormalities is the Foot Drop which is the inability of the tibialis anterior to perform concentric or eccentric action. In such cases, the orthotic should serve the purpose of functionally mimicking the important functions of the tibialis anterior in normal gait.</p>

</section>
<p align="justify">In the case where the person has weak tibialis anterior, if the person attempts to walk in the normal gait cycle he will be unable to clear the ground as the foot would be plantarflexed in the swing phase. This happens due to the absence of the action of the tibialis anterior. More importantly after heel contact, foot slap will occur. Under normal gait, the tibialis anterior would have eccentrically damped this, but absence of its control causes the foot slap.</p>

<font size="3"><b>Abstract</b></font>
<p align="justify">The aim of the project is to develop an orthotic device which can serve as an assistive walker for people suffering from impaired control of the ankle.  The normal gait cycle is used as a reference and the position of the ankle is controlled as a function of the hip angle and the knee angle to get a unique output as a function of the inputs.
The orthotic device attempts to replicate the normal gait kinematics as much as possible.</p>

<p>The Solidworks model is just to demostrate the idea and the idea requires refining. The brown portion represents the human body from thr ground upto the waist.</p>

<p>The red colored portion takes the input of the knee angle and the green portion takes the input of the hip angle and the cam profile is generated such the follower controls the position of the foot to avoid foot drop and to try and replicate the normal gait cycle</p>
