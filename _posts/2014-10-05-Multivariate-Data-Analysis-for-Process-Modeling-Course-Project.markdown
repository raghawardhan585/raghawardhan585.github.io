<font size="3"><b>Abstract</b></font>
<br>
<p>Global Positioning System (GPS) sensors are widely used for tracking moving objects. There has
been a recent drive by State Governments in India to fit auto-meters with GPS sensors primarily for
ensuring the safety of the passenger. It is possible to extract much more valuable information from
the GPS data that is gathered that can be used for valued added services.
We collect GPS data while moving around in a vehicle. An Android application has been created by Prof. Shankar Narasimhan which 
collects GPS data automatically and stores in a server, while we move around.<br><br>The objective of this project is to extract the following
estimates from the inaccurate GPS location and time data <br>(a) total distance travelled in the trip<br>(b)
total waiting time and travel time estimates for the trip <br>(c) Instantaneous speeds throughout the trip.</p>

<font size="3"><b>Abstract</b></font>
<br>
<p align ="justify">The objective of the project is to acquire the images of the four types of leaves and then extract features out of each image and then use k-means clustering to classify them. Then for a fresh set of images, observe how well the leaves are being clustered .</p>
