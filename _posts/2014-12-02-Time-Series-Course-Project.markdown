<font size="3"><b>Problem 1 - Threshold Auto Regressive(TAR) Model Development</b></font>
<p align="justify">The objective of the project is to develop a TAR Model for the given data. A threshold auto-regressive (TAR) model is an extension of the classical AR(P) model to describe non-linear and non-stationary processes. It is, essentially, a multiple-linear model with r regimes determined by thresholds and a delay. The objective is to develop a two regime TAR model and estimate its coefficients, threshold and delay and to perform bootstrap simulations to determine the standard errors. </p>

<font size="3"><b>Problem 2- Seasonal Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average(SARIMA) Model Development</b></font>
<p align ="justify">The objective of the project is to develop a SARIMA Model for the given data. The given dataset seems to exhibit a non stationary trend along with a seasonal component. The objective is to convert the given data set to a stationary dataset by removing the trends and the seasonal components and then fit an ARMA model to the remaining dataset.</p>
