<font size="5"><b>Type of project</b></font>
<p>This is my final year Matsers Degree Project which I started in June,2015 and is expected to be completed by May,2016.</p>
<br>
<font size="5"><b>Span of Topics</b></font>
<p>Non Linear Systems Theory, Bifurcation, Empirical Mode Decomposition,
Wavelet Transform, Feedforward Contol and Identification</p>
<br>
<font size="5"><b>Abstract</b></font>
<p>The objective of the project is to implement a simultaneous time-frequency controller in a Cylindrical Grinding Machine to minimize the Machining Instability and to improve the precision of the Grinding Machine.</p>
<br>
<font size="3"><b>High Speed Low Immersion Milling Model</b></font>
<p>We start with this non linear model to analyze for what cutting conditions, it tends towards instability. Then we implement the Wavelet Based Filtered-x Least Mean Square (WBFXLMS) Controller to this process to stabiliz the process. The later objective is to extend it to the Cylindrical Grinding Process.</p>

<font size="3"><b>Instability Analysis by Empirical Mode Decomposition</b></font>
<p>The technique of coupled Empirical Mode Decomposition and Instantaneous Frequency has been applied to the displacement data of the tool acquired from the above high speed low immersion milling model for various cutting conditions. It can be clearly seen that the process tends towards instability in frequency domain. </p>
