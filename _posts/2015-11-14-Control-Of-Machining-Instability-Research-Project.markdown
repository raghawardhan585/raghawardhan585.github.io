<font size="5"><b>Type of project</b></font>
<p>This is my final year Matsers Degree Project which I started in June,2015 and is expected to be completed by May,2016. You can download the report of the progress made so far <a href="\Control of Machining Instability.pdf" download>here</a></p>
<br>
<font size="5"><b>Span of Topics</b></font>
<p>Non Linear Systems Theory, Bifurcation, Empirical Mode Decomposition,
Wavelet Transform, Feedforward Contol and Identification</p>
<br>
<font size="5"><b>Abstract</b></font>
<p>The objective of the project is to implement the Wavelet Based Filtered-x Least Mean Square(WBFXLMS) Controller, a controller which has a foot in time domain and another foot in frequency domain in a Cylindrical Grinding Machine with the depth of cut as the manipulated variable to minimize the Machining Instability and return the state of the spindle from chaos to periodic.</p>
<br>
<font size="3"><b>High Speed Low Immersion Milling Model</b></font>
<p>We start with this non linear model to analyze how it tends towards instability and first implement the WBFXLMS Controller on this process and then extend it to the Cylindrical Grinding Process</p>

<font size="3"><b>Instability Analysis by Empirical Mode Decomposition</b></font>
<p>Empirical Mode Decomposition alongwith Instantaneous Frequency proved a better technique than Fourier Transform or Time-Frequency Analysisto detect the route to chaos</p>

<p>This is the schematic of the controller. It is yet to be implemented. Please get back to the site later to know the results of iplementation.</p>
