<font size="3"><b>Problem 1- Delay Estimation</b></font>
<p align="justify">Input-output delays are coventionally estimated using cross-correlation, more specifically, using impulse response functions. The objective of the project is to investigate an alternative method of estimating the delay of the process accurately. The phase shift is partly attributed to the dynamics of the system and partly attributed to the system delay. For various frequencies, we remove the phase of the delay free portion of the system from the total phase and the remaining phase for various frequencies is fit in an optimal linear manner to the respective frequencies with the negative of the delay as the slope coefficient.</p>

<font size="3"><b>Problem 2- Compressive Sensing</b></font>
<p align ="justify">The objective of the project is to use the Compressive Sensing technique to find order and the delay of large delay, sparse parametric models by using a small number of samples.The key idea in Compressive Sensing methods is to use sparse representation of signals.</p>
