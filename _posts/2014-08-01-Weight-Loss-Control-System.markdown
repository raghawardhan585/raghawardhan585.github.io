<p>The objective of the project is to study the effects on the body weight caused by food intake comprising of carbohydrates, fats,proteins and water in varying proportions and develop a Weight Loss Control System (WLS) Framework for obese patients to indicate the required food intake based on measurements of body weight and the mass flow rate in the small intestine.
